# TCP/IP model
The TCP/IP model (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol model) is a conceptual framework used to understand and design how data is transmitted over the internet.

TCP/IP Model Layers (4 Layers) -  Network layer - Internet - Transport - Application **(NITA)**

### ICMP
### TCP
### UDP

#### TCP 3 way handshake
The TCP 3-way handshake is the process used to establish a reliable connection between a client and a server before data is exchanged.

### It has 3 steps: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK

Client .................... Server

  | ---- SYN ------------->   |
  
  | <--- SYN-ACK ----------   |
  
  | ---- ACK ------------->   |
  
Connection established
