# A DNS (Domain Name System) is basically the internet’s phone book.

#### What it does

When you type a website like google.com into your browser, DNS translates that human-friendly name into an IP address (like 142.250.190.78) that computers use to find each other on the internet.

#### Why it matters

Humans prefer names

Computers require numbers
DNS connects the two.

#### How it works (simple version)

You enter a domain in your browser.

Your computer asks a DNS server: “What is the IP of this domain?”

The DNS server replies with the correct IP.

### Key pieces

Domain names: google.com, wikipedia.org

DNS servers: machines that store domain → IP mappings

Records: data stored in DNS (A record = IPv4 address, AAAA = IPv6, MX = mail server, etc.)
