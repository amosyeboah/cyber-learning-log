# VPN
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a tool that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. Think of it as a private tunnel that hides what you’re doing online from anyone who might be watching.

## 🛡️ What a VPN Does
1. Hides your IP address

Your real IP (which shows your location + identity) is replaced with the VPN server’s IP.

2. Encrypts your internet traffic

No one—hackers, ISPs, Wi-Fi owners—can see what sites you visit or what you’re doing online.

3. Lets you browse privately

It prevents tracking and improves online privacy.

4. Allows access to restricted content

Some VPNs let you access content blocked in your region (example: streaming, websites).

## 🧩 Why VPNs
